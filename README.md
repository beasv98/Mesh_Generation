# Mesh Generation

This repository contains the implementation of A Mathematical Analysis of Image Mesh Generation Using Delaunay Triangulation and Image Processing Techniques. In this work, we explore the mathematical foundations and algorithms behind the generation of triangular meshes from image data, focusing on binary images with distinct regions, such as white zones.
